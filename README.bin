You should be able to run HCPL from the unpacked directory with: `./hcpl
file.hcpl'.  Type `./hcpl --help' for a list of options. It is important
that you always run ipl from its directory, otherwise it won't start
because it won't find the standard library in `lib/'. To test whether
ipl works on your system you may run `scripts/run-tests.sh'. To edit
*.hcpl files, it is recommended to use the Kate text editor. Syntax
highlighting files for Kate may be installed with:
`scripts/install-kate-files.sh'.

The `examples/' subdirectory contains commented examples which form a
tutorial introduction to IPL. Some knowledge of logic and functional
programming is necessary to understand them. You should read the
examples in their numerical order. In case the highlighting does not
work, there are also html versions of the examples.
