What do you need to compile and use IPL?

* OCaml 3.12.
     Other versions should work, but have not been tested.
* ocamlbuild
     Usually comes together with OCaml.
* m4, sed, diff, GNU make
     Usually preinstalled on a Linux system.
* Kate text editor
     It is not strictly necessary, but highly recommended, because
     syntax highlighting is available and automatically installed
     for this editor.

To compile IPL type:
   * make
To run tests type:
   * make test
To install IPL type:
   * make configure
   * sudo make install

During installation you will be asked for the data directory. In this
directory the examples, the standard library and other data files of
IPL will be stored.

After installation you should be able to run IPL with: `ipl file.ipl'.
Type `ipl --help' for a list of options. To remove IPL from your
system type: `uninstall-ipl' (note: this will remove the data
directory completely).

The `examples/' subdirectory of the data directory contains commented
examples which form a tutorial introduction to IPL. Some knowledge of
logic and functional programming is necessary to understand them. You
should read the examples in their numerical order. Preferably, *.ipl
files should be edited in Kate as syntax highlighting is installed for
this editor. In case the highlighting does not work, there are also html
versions of the examples.
