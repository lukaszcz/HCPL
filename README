What do you need to compile and use HCPL?

* OCaml 3.12.
     Other versions should work, but have not been tested.
* ocamlbuild
     Usually comes together with OCaml.
* m4, sed, diff, GNU make
     Usually preinstalled on a Linux system.
* Kate text editor
     It is not strictly necessary, but highly recommended, because
     syntax highlighting is available and automatically installed
     for this editor.

To compile HCPL type:
   * make
To run tests type:
   * make test
To install HCPL type:
   * make configure
   * make
   * make install

During installation you will be asked for the data directory. In this
directory the examples, the standard library and other data files of
HCPL will be stored.

After installation you should be able to run HCPL with: `hcpl
file.hcpl'.  Type `hcpl --help' for a list of options. To remove HCPL
from your system type: `uninstall-hcpl' (note: this will remove the
data directory completely).

The `examples/' subdirectory of the data directory contains commented
examples which form a tutorial introduction to HCPL. Some knowledge of
logic and functional programming is necessary to understand them. You
should read the examples in their numerical order. Preferably, *.hcpl
files should be edited in Kate as syntax highlighting is installed for
this editor. In case the highlighting does not work, there are also
html versions of the examples.
